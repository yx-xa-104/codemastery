# Control Flow

Control flow statements let your program make decisions and repeat actions. This is what makes programs dynamic and intelligent!

## If Statements

Make decisions based on conditions:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

### If-Else

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("The weather is nice")
```

### If-Elif-Else

Multiple conditions:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

## Comparison Operators

- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal
- `<=` Less than or equal

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x > y)   # True
print(x == y)  # False
print(x != y)  # True
```

## Logical Operators

Combine multiple conditions:

### AND operator

Both conditions must be True:

```python
age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive")
```

### OR operator

At least one condition must be True:

```python
is_weekend = True
is_holiday = False

if is_weekend or is_holiday:
    print("Time to relax!")
```

### NOT operator

Inverts the condition:

```python
is_raining = False

if not is_raining:
    print("Let's go outside!")
```

## For Loops

Repeat code a specific number of times:

```python
# Loop through numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# Output:
# Count: 0
# Count: 1
# Count: 2
# Count: 3
# Count: 4
```

### Loop through lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")
```

### Range with start and end

```python
# range(start, end, step)
for num in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(num)  # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

## While Loops

Repeat while a condition is True:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1

print("Done!")
```

⚠️ **Be careful:** Make sure the condition eventually becomes False, or you'll have an infinite loop!

## Break and Continue

### Break

Exit the loop early:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Stop when i is 5
    print(i)

# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Continue

Skip the current iteration:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # Skip 2
    print(i)

# Output: 0, 1, 3, 4
```

## Nested Loops

Loops inside loops:

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Number Guessing

```python
secret_number = 7
guess = int(input("Guess a number (1-10): "))

if guess == secret_number:
    print("Correct! 🎉")
elif guess < secret_number:
    print("Too low!")
else:
    print("Too high!")
```

### Exercise 2: Even or Odd

```python
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")
```

### Exercise 3: Sum of Numbers

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    total += i

print(f"Sum of 1 to 100: {total}")
```

## Summary

- **If/else:** Make decisions
- **Comparison operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`
- **For loops:** Iterate a fixed number of times
- **While loops:** Repeat while condition is True
- **Break/Continue:** Control loop flow
