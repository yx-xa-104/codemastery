# Welcome to Python Programming

Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language with efficient high-level data structures.

## Your First Python Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare a variable type.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

## Try It Yourself

Run the code below and see the output:

<!-- CodeEditor component will be integrated here -->

```python
# Your first Python program
name = "CodeMastery Student"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
```

## Key Takeaways

- Use `print()` to display output
- Variables store data without type declaration
- Python is beginner-friendly!
