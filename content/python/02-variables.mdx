# Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable - it is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Creating Variables

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 1.68
is_student = True
```

Variables in Python are **dynamically typed**, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.

## Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

### 1. Strings (str)

Text data enclosed in quotes:

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
message = 'Single quotes work too'
multiline = """This is a
multi-line string"""

print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### 2. Numbers

#### Integers (int)

Whole numbers without decimals:

```python
age = 25
year = 2024
negative = -10
```

#### Floats (float)

Numbers with decimal points:

```python
price = 19.99
temperature = -5.5
pi = 3.14159
```

### 3. Booleans (bool)

True or False values:

```python
is_active = True
has_permission = False

print(5 > 3)  # Output: True
print(10 == 5)  # Output: False
```

### 4. None Type

Represents the absence of a value:

```python
result = None
print(result)  # Output: None
```

## Type Checking

Use the `type()` function to check a variable's type:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))   # <class 'int'>
```

## Variable Naming Rules

✅ **Valid names:**

- `user_name`
- `firstName`
- `age2`
- `_private`

❌ **Invalid names:**

- `2name` (can't start with number)
- `user-name` (no hyphens)
- `class` (reserved keyword)

**Best practices:**

- Use descriptive names: `student_count` not `sc`
- Use snake_case for variables: `user_name`
- Constants in UPPERCASE: `MAX_SIZE = 100`

## Type Conversion

Convert between types using built-in functions:

```python
# String to int
age_str = "25"
age_int = int(age_str)

# Int to string
number = 42
text = str(number)

# String to float
price = float("19.99")

print(type(age_int))  # <class 'int'>
```

## Practice Exercise

Try this code yourself:

```python
# Create variables
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Calculate birth year (approximately)
current_year = 2024
birth_year = current_year - age

# Display results
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You were born around {birth_year}")
print(f"Type of name: {type(name)}")
print(f"Type of age: {type(age)}")
```

## Summary

- Variables store data values
- Python is dynamically typed
- Basic types: str, int, float, bool, None
- Use `type()` to check types
- Convert types with `int()`, `str()`, `float()`
- Follow naming conventions
